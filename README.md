# TheRealPizzaBoys

# Installation
1. Open with Folder PyCharm
2. install files in requirements.txt (using e.g venv -> PyCharm should auto pick it up and show a "Install requirements" message.)
3. open config.py and change the database variables to your database credentials. (including an already existing but empty database such as pizzadb)
4. Run the application by pressing the "run" button.
5. go to http://localhost:5000/migrate/seed so your database will be seeded with pizza's, toppings, items and users. (5000 might differ on your device, check what url your terminal gave)
6. now go to the website without /migrate/seed and enjoy.
